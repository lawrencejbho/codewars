# Leetcode problems 

- all neetcode probelms solved in JS
- a lot of the JS solutions on Neetcode's website do not use the same solution in Neetcode's videos making them hard to follow 
- also he tends to use some creative ways of simplifying code at times, I've mostly done solutions in the most basic way without many shortcuts 
- therefore, watching his videos then looking at these JS solutions should make it a lot easier to focus on learning concepts versus fighting syntax.
